Thanks for visiting. This profile contains a multitude of different projects I've created over the years.
My work is scattered over the 'net; if you can't find something on this profile, see also:

- My Minecraft mods are on a [separate account](https://github.com/kosmolot-mods) because there's so many of them.
- Autism-related social activism: [https://kosma.pl/stereotyp]<br>
- Photography & existential despair: [https://kosma.pl/diaries] \[click at your own peril]<br>

Need electronics designed? I'm available for hire: [P.H.U. Kosmopol](https://kosma.pl/kosmopol/)
I specialize in IoT/battery-powered/wireless/communication/interface devices.
